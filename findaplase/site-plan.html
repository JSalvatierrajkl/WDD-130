        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      
      <h3>Main idea</h3> 
      <p>
        The idea of the website is to give people a facility when they are looking for places to play their sports, it should be in majority for young and middle age people who plays sports at places like soccer, volley, tennis, football, baseball, basketball and more fields.
      </p> 
      <h3>Site focus</h3>
      <p>
        The site is focused on a not very explored idea, this can bring users a great and unique experience at participate of a place where they can cross things off the list in one sport day without caring too much in contacting different places and sites. The competition is really low, it can be hard to find a website or webapp with the idea to cover all these necessities, that can be favorable to this site as it gets more use, recommendations and reputation can be a pioneer on the category.
      </p>  
      <h3>What it brings</h3>
      <p>
        It is not too bored looking for fields or places one by one, contacting one and others to know where they can have a match? Instead, you can enjoy of one single place to search a bunch of different options, prices and places, reserve them and pay. It is a place where a group of friends, families and teammates can find whatever they want as closer as possible.
      </p>  
      <h3>Overview</h3> 
      <p>
        It is thought like a simple place with not too much sites inside, with a comfortable dark mode, clear visibility of options, responsive, not too charged, with a good division of information, a simple navigation section and header, a good-looking body with the images of the places you can go, and an effectively footer.

      <h3>Information from the user</h3>
      <p>
        The information it is going to be really breve, only their location to getting the closer places for them, then in case of reservation they must to fill some fields like names, selected schedule, contact info like a cellphone, email and depending the way to pay, it can include card credit data, etc.      
      </p>
      <h3>What the site it gives</h3>
      <p>
        The basis of the platform is to know where the user is, then brings places according to that location, if the user wants, he can pick the place where find those sport fields he is looking for. Then it going to be a filter or division by sports, where you can select directly what you want to play. This card it going to show the free schedules and prices in that place, this includes a contact cellphone, email, or social media like Facebook or Instagram. Once you select the schedule it going to ask you some information, you select the pay way and it is done. You have in only one and simple place all what you need to schedule and compare prices.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <h3>What we expect</h3>
      <p>
        We except the user can enjoy of solution to a sometimes tedious task like call different places, ask for prices, directions, or visiting a bunch of different sites to find good fields. We hope this can help in some manner to free up time and tasks of whom are using our platform, through this and recommendations from them we can keep growing and adding more capacity and expand the site to the world. The expectations are center on help others in these ways and grow as much as we can.
      </p>
      <h3>Roadmap</h3>
      <p>
        We are going to start with the front-end, what includes the html and css files, the interaction to what we want to share to the user and what he finally experience in the site. As I develop my programming skills I will be more qualified to add some features to this site. Some features we will take in the future are taking the real location from the internet navigator, creating functional bottoms where you can save information, the application to the information through back-end, and more.
